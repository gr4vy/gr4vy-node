    * Indicates whether the report\'s scheduling is enabled. This value can only be set to `true` if this is a recurring report.  When this value is set to `true`, the report will be executed at the `next_execution_at` date and time.  When this value is set to `false`, future executions of the report are paused until this value is set to `true` again.  If scheduling is enabled after being disabled, then the `next_execution_at` value is updated if and only if its current value is a past date-time. The `next_execution_at` value is then set to the next closest date-time in the future depending on the values of `schedule` and `schedule_timezone`.
